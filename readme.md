# swift-windows-app
Just some idiot trying to use Swift on windows. 

### Goal: 
Create a simple UI app for package.json scripts.

- Read package.json
   - create UI for reach script idk

## Conclusion:
- Swift is nice and stuff but you probably want to use it on an IOS app or something...
   - Their documentation doesn't even work rn..
